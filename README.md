# LocalFileTransferSockets
A simple Flask webserver that can send files between devices on the same LAN using SocketIO


**Important Note**: this server does not use SSL or take any security measures over these sockets so this server is only designed to be used for devices on the same network and ran on localhost. there are currently no plans to change this

Also the web design is awful... I'm not a web dev but I may or may not improve it depending on how I feel.
